        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There's no better comfort food than soft boiled eggs with buttered toast soldiers. Boiled eggs also feature in a huge range of dishes such as salads, sandwiches and curries, and for some of these dishes, you'll want a harder boiled egg.</p>
        <p>So how do you get perfect soft, medium or hard boiled eggs, every time? A great boiled egg really comes down to timing. Use a timer to keep it precise and remember that the timer needs to start when the water starts simmering. Follow the method below and after doing it a few times you'll be able to cook exactly the boiled eggs you want without even thinking about it.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>tap water</li>
            <li>bread for toasting</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a saucepan and half fill it with cold water from the tap. Gently lower the eggs into the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Place the pan over a  medium heat. When the water reaches a simmer, start the timer so you can precisely time the cooking process. If you gently stir the eggs in a clockwise direction, the movement of the water will help centre the yolks.</li>
            <li>Simmer the eggs in the saucepan for the length of time that suits your boiled eggs preference. </li>
            <li>Use a large spoon to remove the eggs from the water.</li>
            <li>Cool the eggs by running them under cold tap water for 30-60 seconds or placing them in a bowl of iced water.</li>
        </ol>
